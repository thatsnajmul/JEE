Create an abstract class called BankAccount. The BankAccount class should have the following abstract methods:
void deposit(double amount)- withdraw the given amount from the account. double calculateInterest() - Calculate and return the interest earned on the account.
Then, create two subclass of BankAccount:
SavingsAccount: This class should implement the calculateInterest() method to calculate the interest earned based on the balance and a fixed interest rate.
CheckingAccount - This class should implement the withdraw() method to allow withdrawals up to certain limit without
any fee, but charge a fee for withfrawals beyond that limit.
Additionally, create a main class to test your implementations by creating instances of SavingsAccount, performing various operations like deposits, withdrawals, and calculating interst.

===================================================

Create a superclass called Product. The product class has the following fields and methods:
String name;
double regularPrice;
Product(String name, double regularPrice);
double getSalePrice();

==================================================

Create a subclass of product class and name it as ElectronicProduct. 
The ElectronicProduct class has the following fields and methods: int warrantyPeriod;
Override the double getSalePrice() method from its superclass and apply the following logic:
If warrantyPeriod is greater than 1 year, apply a 15% discount on regularPrice. Otherwise, apply no discount.
