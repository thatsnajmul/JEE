// Create an abstract class called BankAccount. The BankAccount class should have the following abstract methods:
//void deposit(double amount)- withdraw the given amount from the account. double calculateInterest() - Calculate
//and return the interest earned on the account.
//Then, create two subclass of BankAccount:
//SavingsAccount: This class should implement the calculateInterest() method to calculate the interest earned based 
//        on the balance and a fixed interest rate.
//CheckingAccount - This class should implement the withdraw() method to allow withdrawals up to certain limit without
//any fee, but charge a fee for withfrawals beyond that limit

//Additionally, create a main class to test your implementations by creating instances of SavingsAccount, performing 
//various operations like deposits, withdrawals, and calculating interst.
