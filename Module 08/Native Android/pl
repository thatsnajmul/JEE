Light Aircraft
Aluminum skin is normally of the minimum practical thickness: 0.015 to 0.025 in. 
Although design strength requirements are relatively low, the skin needs moderately 
high yield strength and hardness to minimize ground damage from stones, debris, mechanics' tools, 
and general handling.

It varies from one part of the airplane to the next based on the loads and strength needed. 
It ranges from thinner than a dime (0.050”) to over 1/2” near the wing/body joints. 
All transport aircraft used what is called a “semi-monocoque” design approach.
A monocoque is where all the strength comes from the skin.
